### Date created
The Bikeshare project was created on Sep 27, 2018 as a part of the Programming for Data Science Nanodegree Program.
### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
Python was used to explore data related to bike share systems for three cities in the United States; Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The purpose was to analyize the data and then draw interesting finding about the data by computing descriptive statistics in terms of five areas such as Popular times of travel, Popular stations and trip, Trip duration, User status, Trip info, and Users info. All these finding were based on raw inputs from users to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
Three city dataset files were used:
* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv

#### The Datasets
According to Udacity, the data are provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States. It was randomly selected for the first six months of 2017 for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:


Start Time | End Time | Trip Duration | Start Station | End Station | User Type
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------- | -------------
e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57 | e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53 | in seconds - e.g., 776 | e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave | e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave | Subscriber or Customer

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

Gender | Birth Year
------------ | -------------
e.g., Male, Female | e.g., 1998
